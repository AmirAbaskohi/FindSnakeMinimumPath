# FindSnakeMinimumPath
In this project I implemented traditional search algorithms to find minimum path for snake to get seeds in the map.

Algorithms that have been used are:

1- BFS Search

2- Iteration Depth Search(IDS)

3- A*(using two differnet heuristics)

4- Wighted A*

Each Algorithm has it's own python script file.

## How to run?

To run scipts easily you can use this command:

```bash
python file_name.py
```

You input should look like ones that are in the test files.

Also you can use available test provided to you.
